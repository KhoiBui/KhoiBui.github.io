<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
We went over the heap in class. Dr. Downing is incredibly good at pointing out the subtleties of C++. However, I wish
the class would focus more on some of the Object Oriented Programming concepts that were discussed in the book. My parner 
and I also started working on our Allocator project. It seemed straight forward at first, but we ran into a few situations
where we weren't careful with indexing through the given array and caused the program to misbehave. The test cases were
also a little tough to decipher, so debugging our messy code had been quite a challenge.
<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
I have to get started on the Algorithm homework, which always requires a huge chunk of time to complete. One of the obstacles
I've encountered while working on the recent project is that I don't understand a lot of what the code is trying to do.
For example, I made a separate function to grab 4 bytes from char a[N] and convert it to an int to be used as the sentinel
before realizing that Dr. Downing had already provided a way for us to easily use [] instead. I have a lot more to learn about 
C++ and how it interacts with Google Test before I can start writing more test cases for the project.
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
We're looking to focus on wrapping up the Allocator project. Other than that and the Algo homework, it's going to be a pretty
relaxed week before another round of exams and interviews. I'll also be catching up on the readings for my classes as well.
<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
NBA 2016-2017 season will officially start on October 25th.
