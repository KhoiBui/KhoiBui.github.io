<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

My partner and I ended up getting our project to work way ahead of schedule. This left us with plenty of time to clean up
our code and write unit tests without having to rush through it all an hour prior to the deadline. Overall, I felt Life was 
much easier than Darwin and avoiding getters and setters was not as much of a challenge as before.

It felt a little weird stuffing Life.h with over 500 lines of code, but there weren't much we could do about it. I would have
liked to put the actual implementations into a .c++ file because I always thought header files are supposed to be small and
only used for declarations. Most of the code for the cell classes were very small. The Life class made up almost half of the
total lines of code that we wrote. 

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

I have to glance over my Networks project one last time before I turn it in tomorrow. The last required Algo homework seems 
very difficult, hopefully I'm wrong on that. I don't have any finals this semester, so my last day of class will be on Monday
December 5th. However, I have two exams that day and the OOP exam is the Thursday of the week after break. That's a lot of 
materials that I have to catch up on if I want to finish up the semester on a good note.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

Gonna finish up that Algo homework and then eat so much I'm gonna pass out for a few days.

<h2>Pick of the Week</h2>
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a beautiful movie about a famous concierge and his loyal bellhop on their various adventures after
a well known regular at the hotel suddenly dies. I don't want to reveal too much so I would like to suggest to anyone that it 
is worth immersing yourself into over the break.
