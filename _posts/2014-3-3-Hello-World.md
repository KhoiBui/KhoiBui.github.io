<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
I did not do much this past week on account of it being the first week of school and because I was recuperating for
lack of sleep by sleeping too much. My summer internship started at 8am every day. Since I'm not very good at going
to bed at a reasonable time, waking up in the morning became increasingly difficult as the summer moved on. Past
classes had been rather relaxed at the beginning, but this semester is just the opposite. We hit the ground running. 
OOP has been very engaging and informative. It is one of the very few classes that I wish would go on longer. What I
enjoy most about the class is that it tries to bridge, as much as possible, the gap between university and industry. 
I also got the chance to set up this blog as well as Docker, both of which took an embarassingly large chunk of time.
<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
I've always been quite good about managing my time, but I can't say the same for motivation. At the start of summer,
I told myself that I would learn c++. So far, the only thing I know about the language is what we've covered in the
past two days of class. The readings are also starting to pile up, which is never a good sign. I'm jumping on it as
soon as I can though. The last thing in my way is the constant ringing in my ears from the Slipknot concert on
Saturday. It was something worth procrastinating for.
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
I'm going to catch up on everything that I need to do next week. A while back I mistakenly agreed to help a good friend
with an Android mobile application without really knowing anything about Android development. The idea sounded very
simple but is a different story in practice. I'll have to buckle down and cram my head into every Android book I can
find.
<h2>Tip of the week</h2>
Consider giving zsh a shot. It has all of the functionalities of bash but with tons of extra plugins and pretty themes.
Here is a repo to get you started: [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
