<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

I studied for our last exam of the class on Thursday.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

Studying for Networks and Algo. My exam for both classes are on Monday, December 5th and I am done with the semester afterwards.
Although I'm very excited that my semester will be ending so early, a part of me wishes that the last two exams were more spaced
out so that I have more time to prepare for them.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

Take my exams! Then I'm going to catch up on sleep and wait for my mini Las Vegas vacation.

<h2>Closing thoughts on CS371p Object Oriented Programming</h2>

One of the reasons I registered for OOP with Professor Downing was because of his reputation for being a gifted lecturer.
Dr. Downing has a talent for being able to unravel complicated subjects into something more digestible. It is very clear from the
examples that he goes over in class that he has a very deep understanding of the nuances of C++ and the structure of the language
itself. 

That being said, the other aspects of the class isn't as enjoyable or as exciting as the lectures. Firstly, the pacing of the 5
projects could use a little reorganizing. Projects 1, 2, and 3 were meant to familiarize the students with some C++ semantics and 
the various tools that we were required to use. Projects 4 and 5 taught actual object oriented design and best practices. Prior to
that learning OOP was done by reading the textbook, but that felt more optional as the weeks passed by. The time that it took to 
complete projects 1, 2, and 3 could be squeeze into the time it took to complete project 4. In other words the class picked up in
difficulty and commitment very rapidly towards the end of the semester.

Secondly, having automated builds for the projects was nice, but knowing how to create these builds is, in my opinion, more valuable.
Anyone can type "make" and "make clean". I think more emphasis should be placed on encouraging students to create and modify the 
makefiles and .travis.yml files. Having these things given on a per project basis with little to no variations provides no motivation
for the students to exercise the "Independent Inquiry" component of the class and explore how these technologies work. 

Thirdly, the requirements and penalties for project submission should be slightly altered. Small mistakes in a submission could lead
to huge amount of points being taken off. This causes many students, myself included, to constantly stress over turning in a project.
In the real world proper deployment is a big issue and I understand that Dr. Downing is trying to teach us to be careful with all phases
of software development. However, it's a little unreasonable to expect complete and correct submissions given incomplete requirements.
There was a point in time where the requirement for naming our project repository was changed less than an hour before the deadline. This
change was unannounced and generated a lot of confusion.

Every class has it flaws. I still enjoyed CS371p and thought it was a valuable learning experience. I do wish that many things about it
would be different in the future to help the course flow smoother than it did for us this semester. For a class that was supposed to
be the guinea pig for testing new tools to manage classroom continuous integrationg and repositories, I was still able to walk away 
satisfied with the things I've learned.
