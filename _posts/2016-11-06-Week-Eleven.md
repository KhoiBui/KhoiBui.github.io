<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

My partner and I worked on and off for the Darwin project up until the day it was due. We both decided that studying for
the Algorithm exam was more important. When we met up again to finish up the project on the day it was due, we realized that
our code relied heavily on getters and setters. How we didn't catch it sooner is a mystery. Refactoring our code to abide to
the requirements took up the rest of the day and by the time we got everything working, we had less than two hours to write
unit tests, document the code, and make sure the repositories and builds are in an acceptable state.

All of the headaches we experienced on Thursday could have been avoided if we had spent more time designing rather than 
coding. Making the UML diagram at the beginning of the project gave us a false perception of our progress. When it was time
for the actual implementation, the flaws in our design started showing up and we reverted to writing spaghetti code.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

As of right now, relatively little. I don't have Networks or Algo homeworks due this week, so a lot of time is going to be
devoted to working on Project 5.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

Work on Project 5 and get ahead in my classes, hopefully. Although I did a lot better than I expected on the first exam
for this class, I can't say the same for other classes. Bombing the first exam in any class is a huge demotivator for the
rest of the semester. 

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>

[LetterBoxd](https://letterboxd.com/) is a great avenue for discussing/reviewing movies online. Although I don't personally write 
reviews for movies I've seen, I always enjoy reading what others have to say about them.
