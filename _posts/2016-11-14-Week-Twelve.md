<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

We worked on the Life project and made significant progress on Saturday. Once my partner and I figure out how to deal with 
initializing Life with Cell and get it to behave properly, we should be done with the project. Once again, I am not looking 
forward to writing unit tests because there are just so many methods that we had to define.

Being familiar with writing unit tests is a valuable skill, but being required to write an average of three unit tests per
method can lead to very sloppy code. Sometimes we are tempted to squeeze as much as we can into one function instead of
splitting a big function into smaller parts. Our development strategy eventually becomes - for every function we can avoid 
writing, we are also avoiding three extra unit tests. In other cases, we would write meaningless tests just to get it over 
with. 

For Allocator, I actually spent a good amount of time thinking of interesting test cases to write because we didn't have many 
methods to test. This was different for Darwin where we would have to write over 70 unit tests to meet the requirement. We had 
to sprinkle some very low quality/shabby tests here and there. Of course, in an industry setting this would be a different 
story, but for a project of this scope that amount seems a little unreasonable. But then again, this could just be a product
of my partner and I being lazy.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

I have to start working on the Algo homework, but before that I have to review the class notes because that class is almost
impossible for me to stay awake in. Life is due on Thursday and although I'm happy about where we are on the project, I still
think our implementation is a little fragile. We will have to look over the code a couple more times and write unit tests.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

Finish the Algo homework and the Life project, then I'm gonna treat myself afterwards by going to see Grouplove perform at
Stubb's.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
Don't be tempted to use any command with "sudo" on the UTCS Linux machines. You'll get a strongly worded email from gripe.
