title: Week 7

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
Aside from studying for the exam on Thursday, this past week had been incredibly relaxing. I'm not looking forward
to it ending. I was expecting the exam to be much more tricky than it actually was. However, I still have some
concerns with the palindrome questions.

One of the tenets of C++ taught to us by Dr. Downing is that algorithms should demand the weakest iterator. I took
this philosophy to heart when I approached the first question which asked for the solution using a random access
iterator. Since RI possesses all of the operators available to a bidirectional iterator, I was able to find a
solution that only needed a BI. It worked and it was simple. When I saw the second palindrome question, I became a 
lot more skeptical of my answer. The solution I had worked out to both questions look almost identical. Although I'm 
confident that they both work, I'm not so sure that I would get full credit for only using a BI instead of RI even if 
we were taught to use the weakest iterator.
<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
I only have a small portion of the Algo homework to do and the entirety of Networks to work on. I'm also not too
excited to start Project 3 for OOP, but maybe that will change.
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
I have a few more interviews to get through and hopefully I will be hearing back about decisions from other companies.
I'm also going to be crossing my fingers that more people will drop out of going to HackTx so I can take their place.
<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
Create aliases to improve your Bash experience. They're very easy to pick up and get started. Just edit your
.bashrc/.zshrc file or whatever shell you use. An alias can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. For
example, I use this alias to ssh into a UTCS machine: '''alias skip="khoi94@skipper.cs.utexas.edu'''
